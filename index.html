    <div class="prompt-box">
        <strong>Argumentative Prompt:</strong> To what extent do teen films reinforce harmful beauty standards and gender expectations?
    </div>

    <div class="thesis">
        Thesis: Although presented as a harmless romantic comedy, She's All That reinforces damaging social hierarchies by equating physical transformation with worth, portraying popularity as success, and positioning male approval as the ultimate validation for women.
    </div>

    <div class="examples">
        <strong>Evidence:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>The prom-queen bet reduces Laney to a social experiment, showing that social status can be manipulated through appearance rather than personal character.</li>
            <li>The makeover sequence (removing glasses, changing clothing) implies that social acceptance is contingent on conforming to conventional beauty standards.</li>
            <li>Mean Girls demonstrates how social value among adolescents is dictated by rigid popularity hierarchies, with attractiveness, social alliances, and conformity shaping who is accepted. The “Plastics” function as a symbolic representation of cultural pressure to perform beauty and social norms, showing that identity and worth are socially constructed rather than intrinsic.</li>
            <li>The Princess Diaries (2001), where Mia’s makeover (hair, clothes, posture) is what enables her to be publicly recognized as a princess, emphasizing that appearance validates social worth.</li>

        <strong>Argumentative Prompt:</strong> Is professional fulfillment more strongly shaped by purpose than by salary or status?
    </div>

    <div class="thesis">
        Thesis: While society often measures success through income and prestige, long-term professional fulfillment is more deeply rooted in purpose, relational impact, and the ability to influence others meaningfully.

    <div class="examples">
        <strong>Evidence:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Officiating a former student’s wedding, demonstrating fulfillment rooted in long-term influence rather than compensation.</li>
            <li>Turning Personal Failure into Teaching Philosophy</li>
            <li>Mean Girls demonstrates how social value among adolescents is dictated by rigid popularity hierarchies, with attractiveness, social alliances, and conformity shaping who is accepted.
